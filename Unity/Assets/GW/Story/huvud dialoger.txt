Eleanor:
“Where am i? what’s going on?”
*knock on window* (yes/no)
“Angela? you there? can you hear me?” 
It looks as if Angela is frozen for a second and then she turns towards the mirror.


Angela:
“Eleanor! Oh thank goodness, you’re okay!” 


Eleanor:
“Who cares about me, I’ve been through worse. How are you? are you okay?”


Angela:
“Who cares? I care! I’m doing fine now that I know you are fine.” 


“...”


“I think we need to look around to see if we can find a way to each other”


Eleanor:
“Alright, yeah. Sounds good, I’ll start looking over here then.”


Spelaren är i tavelrummet, Eleanor sida. PÅ köksbordet ligger det en lapp

tavlor: “why are these on the floor?” 
        boxning-tavla:
        Deltagare pris, en ung Eleanor med sina föräldrar och förstapriset.
        “Mom actually smiled here, and it wasn’t malicious at all. Dad was so excited about me getting a prize. It was just a participation award but dad made it feel like I had won the biggest prize in the world.”
                “It’s was a long time ago boxing actually made me happy.”
        Dörr med rök:
        Under branden var Eleanor instängd i sitt rum, utan någon aning att branden var i full gång. Därför är denna tavlan på hennes dörr där röken tar sig in genom springorna.
        “I hated that day. Why did you have to run in after me? Just.. why? Maybe you could’ve prevented mom from getting bad.” 
mamman:
En bild på mamman med cigg i handen, står ute på en balkong. Man kan även se någon typ av alkohol flaska.
        “I remember that day after the funeral. Mom refused to look at me. I can’t believe she screamed ‘I wished it was you who died’ to me.. Do you even miss me mom? Are you even alive today?”


Objek dialoger:


Blomkruka: “oh my god it actually smells like hers.”


ugnen: “There’s something in there”
*open?* (yes/no)
*no* “Alright then.”
*yes* -> oven opens “Why is there a painting in here?” 
        examine painting (door & smoke) -> “What the hell is this?” 


examine painting on wall (boxning) -> “That’s me, in the ring at 12 years old.” 


Klarade puzzel Eleanor men inte Angela: “Something is missing… *kicks the door*.” 


Tavlor Angela:


Tavla 1: Två barn som sitter i slutet på en brygga, men ryggarna emot och tittar på en solnedgång.
“I haven’t been by any beach after that day you died. Thinking about you makes my heart hurt and tears comes to my eyes.”

2: Angela i förgrunden som simmar in, medans hennes brors händer är det enda som syns när han drar under.
“Who would be doing something like this to us? This is just cruelness.”

3: Begravningen. Silhuetter runt en grav.
“The cries of my mom stills echoes in my dreams, maybe because she cried every night for a months after the funeral. And dad became very cold. They loved me, but with a sadness.”


Angela puzzel är klara men inte Eleanor: “I must be missing something. *Handtagsljud.*”


Angela: “Do you have paintings in your room also?”


Eleanor: “Yeah they are there... “

Eleanor: “Paintings of my life… this is a level of creepy stalking.”


Angela: “It is a long time of stalking in that case, and I can say for certain that no one was there that day on one of mine.”


Eleanor: “What are your paintings about?”


Angela: “My nightmares. Yours?”


Eleanor: “... Of things that will never be again.”
