Dagbokssida 2: Fyren Torekov: Dagen innan han dog
        “Today has been really fun! The whole family is on a trip to Torekov! André took me out to the lighthouse, it’s very old! We weren’t allowed to go up into it but the view from ground was still as amazing. We sat down on some rocks to enjoy the scenery. We talked for a while, about nothing and everything.
After a bit he pointed out a small beach which seemed to be less populated than the rest. He promised to take me there swimming tomorrow! I love spending time with him, he’s the best big brother anyone could ask for. He means the world to me.”


        “Little did I know that my world was gonna end the next day. We should’ve just gone to one of the other beaches…”
        “We should’ve realized there was a reason people kept away from that beach.”


Dagbokssida 3: Skolminne: Engelska lektion där de går igenom amerikanska poeter.
        “Today we learned about American poets, and there was one poem that stood out. ‘Death by water’ by T.S Eliot. It reminded me of you, and my heart hurts as memories of that day come rushing back to me. 


“ A current under sea 
Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell “


I miss you André. I miss you so much my whole body aches. The world is cruel for taking you away from us. I’ve spent many nights crying in my room. But I need to be strong, for mom and dad. They miss you a lot you know? We all miss you and love you so so much. 
I hope you have found peace wherever you are. There isn’t much left down here.”

	"I still miss you a lot André, but I have to move on. I can't live like this, with sadness in my whole being. I think you wouldn't want me to either..."
